Did you ever ask why this exist. Me neither but its here. And it will be here.
So what can you do?

Well its simple as air. (Maybe no)

Its console based. So to do anything the program will gently ask you to confirm your name. Its derived from username on windows accounts.
But you can also change that name if you really want to. After some first setup. You will be brought to the main stuff.
It will ask you to type something. You can type something like "You smell really bad :(" and it will space every character by space. HOW AWSOME?
You can use 2 commands.

**(commands are enclosed with "_")**
1. **cancel** = you will cancel the current program
2. **name** = changes your name

Names are saved trought windows registry.
This app is completly usless :) ENJOY...
